This repository demonstrates **image classification on the Fashion-MNIST dataset** using five approaches:

- **Neural Network (NN)** – Fully connected baseline  
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** – From scratch conv layers  
- **Transfer Learning (VGG-19)** – Pretrained on ImageNet  
- **Transfer Learning (ResNet50)** – Pretrained residual network  
- **Transfer Learning (DenseNet121)** – Pretrained densely connected network

## 📂 Dataset

We use the **Fashion-MNIST dataset**, a modern alternative to MNIST:

- 70,000 grayscale images (28×28 pixels, 10 classes)  
- 60,000 training + 10,000 test images  
- Classes: *T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot*

## 🧠 Models

### 1️⃣ Neural Network (Baseline)
- `Flatten → Dense(128, ReLU) → Dense(64, ReLU) → Dense(10, Softmax)`  
- Optimizer: **Adam**  
- Loss: **Categorical Crossentropy**  
- Accuracy: ~83%  

---

### 2️⃣ CNN (Scratch)
- `Conv2D → ReLU → MaxPooling → Dropout → Dense classifier`  
- Accuracy: ~90–92%  

---

### 3️⃣ VGG-19 (Transfer Learning)
- Input resized: **28×28 → 224×224×3**  
- Backbone: `VGG19(include_top=False, weights="imagenet")`  
- Custom dense layers added  
- Accuracy: ~93–95%  

---

### 4️⃣ ResNet50 (Transfer Learning)
- Input: 224×224×3 (ImageNet preprocessing)  
- Backbone: `ResNet50(include_top=False, weights="imagenet")`  
- Head: GAP → Dense(10, Softmax)  
- Accuracy: ~93–95%  

---

### 5️⃣ DenseNet121 (Transfer Learning)
- Input: 224×224×3 (ImageNet preprocessing)  
- Backbone: `DenseNet121(include_top=False, weights="imagenet")`  
- Head: GAP → Dense(10, Softmax)  
- Accuracy: ~94–96%
