# 👟 Fashion-MNIST Classification

This repository demonstrates **image classification on the Fashion-MNIST dataset** using three approaches:

1. **Neural Network (NN)** – Fully connected baseline  
2. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** – Feature extraction with Conv layers  
3. **Transfer Learning (VGG-19)** – Leveraging pretrained ImageNet weights

## 📂 Dataset

We use the **Fashion-MNIST dataset**, a modern alternative to MNIST:
- 70,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels, 10 classes)
- 60,000 training + 10,000 test images
- Classes: *T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, Ankle boot*
